# LAUNDPAD ðŸš€ : A simple API client

LaunchPad ðŸš€ is a simple API testing client. It is a simple alternative to PostMan and PostWoman. LaunchPad ðŸš€ is built for people who need to test APIs on the go, it is web based to you have to launch PostMan and wait for it to load.
You need to know that LaunchPad ðŸš€ is not a full test client and can only be use to check if an API is working and to make POST, GET, DELETE and PUT from an endpoint.
Postman is a complete API testing tool and i recommend it.
